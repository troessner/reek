Feature: Overriding current rules by specifying new configuration values
  In order to customize Reek to suit my needs
  As a developer
  I want to be able to override the default configuration values

  Scenario: List of configuration values is overridden by a lower config file
    When I run reek spec/samples/overrides_defaults/camel_case.rb
    Then the exit status indicates smells
    And it reports:
      """
      spec/samples/overrides_defaults/camel_case.rb -- 1 warning:
        [9]:CamelCase#initialize has the variable name 'x1' (UncommunicativeVariableName)
      """
