Feature: Correctly formatted reports
  In order to get the most out of Reek

  I want to be able to parse Reek's output simply and consistently

  Scenario Outline: two reports run together with indented smells
    Given a directory called 'smelly' containing two smelly files
    When I run reek <args>
    Then the exit status indicates smells
    And it reports:
