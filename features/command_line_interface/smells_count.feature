Feature: Reports total number of code smells
    In order to monitor the total number of smells
    Reek outputs the total number of smells among all files inspected.

    Scenario: Does not output total number of smells when inspecting single file
        When I run reek spec/samples/not_quite_masked/dirty.rb
        Then the exit status indicates smells
        And it reports:
        """
