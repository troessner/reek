Feature: Reports total number of code smells
  In order to monitor the total number of smells
  Reek outputs the total number of smells among all files inspected.

  Scenario: Does not output total number of smells when inspecting single file
    Given a smelly file called 'smelly.rb'
    When I run reek smelly.rb
    Then the exit status indicates smells
    And it reports:
      """
      smelly.rb -- 4 warnings:

  Scenario: Output total number of smells when inspecting multiple files
    Given a directory called 'smelly' containing two smelly files
