Feature: The Reek CLI maintains backwards compatibility
  In order to use Reek without fuss
  As a developer
  I want to have a stable basic command line interface

  Scenario: the demo example reports as expected
    Given the smelly file 'demo.rb' from the example in the README
    When I run reek demo.rb
    Then the exit status indicates smells
    And it reports:
      """
      demo.rb -- 8 warnings:
        [1]:Dirty has no descriptive comment (IrresponsibleModule)
        [3]:Dirty#awful has 4 parameters (LongParameterList)
