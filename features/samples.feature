Feature: Basic smell detection
  In order to write better software
  As a developer
  I want to detect the smells in my Ruby code

  Scenario: Correct smells from inline.rb
    Given the smelly file 'inline.rb'
    And the smelly file 'optparse.rb'
    And the smelly file 'redcloth.rb'
    When I run reek --no-line-numbers inline.rb optparse.rb redcloth.rb
    Then the exit status indicates smells
    And it reports:
