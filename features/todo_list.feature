Feature:

  Write a Reek configuration as a kind of todo list that will prevent Reek
  from reporting smells on the current code.
  This can then be worked on later on.
  The main goal here would be to ease the Reek adoption by allowing developers to:
    - introduce Reek right away (e.g. for CI)
    - exclude the "old" smells from getting reported
    - fix them step by step
    - get rid of the todo file

  Scenario: Generate a proper todo file that disables all found smells
    Given a smelly file called 'smelly.rb'
    When I run reek smelly.rb
    Then the exit status indicates smells
    And it reports:
      """
