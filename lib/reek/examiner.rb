      Source %s can not be processed by Reek.

      This is most likely either a bug in your Reek configuration (config file or
      source code comments) or a Reek bug.

      Please double check your Reek configuration taking the original exception
      below into account -  you might have misspelled a smell detector for instance.
      (In the future Reek will handle configuration errors more gracefully, something
      we are working on already).

      If you feel that this is not a problem with your Reek configuration but with
      Reek itself it would be great if you could report this back to the Reek
      team by opening up a corresponding issue at https://github.com/troessner/reek/issues.

      Please make sure to include the source in question, the Reek version
      and the original exception below.
