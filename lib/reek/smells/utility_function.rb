    # A Utility Function is any instance method that has no
    # dependency on the state of the instance.
    #
    # Currently +UtilityFunction+ will warn about any method that:
    #
    # * is non-empty, and
    # * does not override an inherited method, and
    # * calls at least one method on another object, and
    # * doesn't use any of self's instance variables, and
    # * doesn't use any of self's methods
    #
    # A Utility Function often arises because it must manipulate
    # other objects (usually its arguments) to get them into a
    # useful form; one force preventing them (the
    # arguments) doing this themselves is that the common
    # knowledge lives outside the arguments, or the arguments
    # are of too basic a type to justify extending that type.
    # Therefore there must be something which 'knows' about the contents
    # or purposes of the arguments.  That thing would have to
    # be more than just a basic type, because the basic types
    # are either containers which don't know about their
    # contents, or they are single objects which can't capture
    # their relationship with their fellows of the same type.
    # So, this thing with the extra knowledge should be
    # reified into a class, and the utility method will most
    # likely belong there.
