    # Simulated Polymorphism occurs when
    # * code uses a case statement (especially on a type field);
    # * or code has several if statements in a row
    #   (especially if they're comparing against the same value);
    # * or code uses instance_of?, kind_of?, is_a?, or ===
    #   to decide what type it's working with;
    # * or multiple conditionals in different places test the same value.
    #
    # Conditional code is hard to read and understand, because the reader must
    # hold more state in his head.
    # When the same value is tested in multiple places throughout an application,
    # any change to the set of possible values will require many methods and
    # classes to change. Tests for the type of an object may indicate that the
    # abstraction represented by that type is not completely defined (or understood).
    #
    # +RepeatedConditional+ checks for multiple conditionals
    # testing the same value throughout a single class.
    #
    # See {file:docs/Repeated-Conditional.md} for details.
