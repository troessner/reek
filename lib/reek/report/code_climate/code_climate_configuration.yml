Attribute:
  remediation_points: 250_000
  content: |
    A class that publishes a setter for an instance variable invites client classes to become too intimate with its inner workings, and in particular with its representation of state.

    The same holds to a lesser extent for getters, but Reek doesn't flag those.

    ## Example

    Given:

    ```Ruby
    class Klass
      attr_accessor :dummy
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    reek test.rb

    test.rb -- 1 warning:
      [2]:Klass declares the writable attribute dummy (Attribute)
    ```
BooleanParameter:
  remediation_points: 500_000
  content: |
    `Boolean Parameter` is a special case of `Control Couple`, where a method parameter is defaulted to true or false. A _Boolean Parameter_ effectively permits a method's caller to decide which execution path to take. This is a case of bad cohesion. You're creating a dependency between methods that is not really necessary, thus increasing coupling.

    ## Example

    Given

    ```Ruby
    class Dummy
      def hit_the_switch(switch = true)
        if switch
          puts 'Hitting the switch'
          # do other things...
        else
          puts 'Not hitting the switch'
          # do other things...
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 3 warnings:
      [1]:Dummy#hit_the_switch has boolean parameter 'switch' (BooleanParameter)
      [2]:Dummy#hit_the_switch is controlled by argument switch (ControlParameter)
    ```

    Note that both smells are reported, `Boolean Parameter` and `Control Parameter`.

    ## Getting rid of the smell

    This is highly dependant on your exact architecture, but looking at the example above what you could do is:

    * Move everything in the `if` branch into a separate method
    * Move everything in the `else` branch into a separate method
    * Get rid of the `hit_the_switch` method alltogether
    * Make the decision what method to call in the initial caller of `hit_the_switch`
ClassVariable:
  remediation_points: 350_000
  content: |
    Class variables form part of the global runtime state, and as such make it easy for one part of the system to accidentally or inadvertently depend on another part of the system. So the system becomes more prone to problems where changing something over here breaks something over there. In particular, class variables can make it hard to set up tests (because the context of the test includes all global state).

    For a detailed explanation, check out [this article](http://4thmouse.com/index.php/2011/03/20/why-class-variables-in-ruby-are-a-bad-idea/)

    ## Example

    Given

    ```Ruby
    class Dummy
      @@class_variable = :whatever
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    reek test.rb

    test.rb -- 1 warning:
      [2]:Dummy declares the class variable @@class_variable (ClassVariable)
    ```

    ## Getting rid of the smell

    You can use class-instance variable to mitigate the problem (as also suggested in the linked article above):

    ```Ruby
    class Dummy
      @class_variable = :whatever
    end
    ```
ControlParameter:
  remediation_points: 500_000
  content: |
    `Control Parameter` is a special case of `Control Couple`

    ## Example

    A simple example would be the "quoted" parameter in the following method:

    ```Ruby
    def write(quoted)
      if quoted
        write_quoted @value
      else
        write_unquoted @value
      end
    end
    ```

    Fixing those problems is out of the scope of this document but an easy solution could be to remove the "write" method alltogether and to move the calls to "write_quoted" / "write_unquoted" in the initial caller of "write".
DataClump:
  remediation_points: 250_000
  content: |
    In general, a `Data Clump` occurs when the same two or three items frequently appear together in classes and parameter lists, or when a group of instance variable names start or end with similar substrings.

    The recurrence of the items often means there is duplicate code spread around to handle them. There may be an abstraction missing from the code, making the system harder to understand.

    ## Example

    Given

    ```Ruby
    class Dummy
      def x(y1,y2); end
      def y(y1,y2); end
      def z(y1,y2); end
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 1 warning:
      [2, 3, 4]:Dummy takes parameters [y1, y2] to 3 methods (DataClump)
    ```

    A possible way to fix this problem (quoting from [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DataClump.html)):

    > The first step is to replace data clumps with objects and use the objects whenever you see them. An immediate benefit is that you'll shrink some parameter lists. The interesting stuff happens as you begin to look for behavior to move into the new objects.
DuplicateMethodCall:
  remediation_points: 350_000
  content: |
    Duplication occurs when two fragments of code look nearly identical, or when two fragments of code have nearly identical effects at some conceptual level.

    Reek implements a check for _Duplicate Method Call_.

    ## Example

    Here's a very much simplified and contrived example. The following method will report a warning:

    ```Ruby
    def double_thing()
      @other.thing + @other.thing
    end
    ```

    One quick approach to silence Reek would be to refactor the code thus:

    ```Ruby
    def double_thing()
      thing = @other.thing
      thing + thing
    end
    ```

    A slightly different approach would be to replace all calls of `double_thing` by calls to `@other.double_thing`:

    ```Ruby
    class Other
      def double_thing()
        thing + thing
      end
    end
    ```

    The approach you take will depend on balancing other factors in your code.
FeatureEnvy:
  remediation_points: 500_000
  content: |
    _Feature Envy_ occurs when a code fragment references another object more often than it references itself, or when several clients do the same series of manipulations on a particular type of object.

    _Feature Envy_ reduces the code's ability to communicate intent: code that "belongs" on one class but which is located in another can be hard to find, and may upset the "System of Names" in the host class.

    _Feature Envy_ also affects the design's flexibility: A code fragment that is in the wrong class creates couplings that may not be natural within the application's domain, and creates a loss of cohesion in the unwilling host class.

    _Feature Envy_ often arises because it must manipulate other objects (usually its arguments) to get them into a useful form, and one force preventing them (the arguments) doing this themselves is that the common knowledge lives outside the arguments, or the arguments are of too basic a type to justify extending that type. Therefore there must be something which 'knows' about the contents or purposes of the arguments.  That thing would have to be more than just a basic type, because the basic types are either containers which don't know about their contents, or they are single objects which can't capture their relationship with their fellows of the same type. So, this thing with the extra knowledge should be reified into a class, and the utility method will most likely belong there.

    ## Example

    Running Reek on:

    ```Ruby
    class Warehouse
      def sale_price(item)
        (item.price - item.rebate) * @vat
      end
    end
    ```

    would report:

    ```Bash
    Warehouse#total_price refers to item more than self (FeatureEnvy)
    ```

    since this:

    ```Ruby
    (item.price - item.rebate)
    ```

    belongs to the Item class, not the Warehouse.
InstanceVariableAssumption:
  remediation_points: 350_000
  content: |
    Classes should not assume that instance variables are set or present outside of the current class definition.

    Good:

    ```Ruby
    class Foo
      def initialize
        @bar = :foo
      end

      def foo?
        @bar == :foo
      end
    end
    ```

    Good as well:

    ```Ruby
    class Foo
      def foo?
        bar == :foo
      end

      def bar
        @bar ||= :foo
      end
    end
    ```

    Bad:

    ```Ruby
    class Foo
      def go_foo!
        @bar = :foo
      end

      def foo?
        @bar == :foo
      end
    end
    ```

    ## Example

    Running Reek on:

    ```Ruby
    class Dummy
      def test
        @ivar
      end
    end
    ```

    would report:

    ```Bash
      [1]:InstanceVariableAssumption: Dummy assumes too much for instance variable @ivar [https://github.com/troessner/reek/blob/master/docs/Instance-Variable-Assumption.md]
    ```

    Note that this example would trigger this smell warning as well:

    ```Ruby
    class Parent
      def initialize(omg)
        @omg = omg
      end
    end

    class Child < Parent
      def foo
        @omg
      end
    end
    ```

    The way to address the smell warning is that you should create an `attr_reader` to use `@omg` in the subclass and not access `@omg` directly like this:

    ```Ruby
    class Parent
      attr_reader :omg

      def initialize(omg)
        @omg = omg
      end
    end

    class Child < Parent
      def foo
        omg
      end
    end
    ```

    Directly accessing instance variables is considered a smell because it [breaks encapsulation](http://designisrefactoring.com/2015/03/29/organizing-data-self-encapsulation/) and makes it harder to reason about code.

    If you don't want to expose those methods as public API just make them private like this:

    ```Ruby
    class Parent
      def initialize(omg)
        @omg = omg
      end

      private
      attr_reader :omg
    end

    class Child < Parent
      def foo
        omg
      end
    end
    ```


    ## Current Support in Reek

    An instance variable must:

    * be set in the constructor
    * or be accessed through a method with lazy initialization / memoization.

    If not, _Instance Variable Assumption_ will be reported.
IrresponsibleModule:
  remediation_points: 350_000
  content: |
    Classes and modules are the units of reuse and release. It is therefore considered good practice to annotate every class and module with a brief comment outlining its responsibilities.

    ## Example

    Given

    ```Ruby
    class Dummy
      # Do things...
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 1 warning:
      [1]:Dummy has no descriptive comment (IrresponsibleModule)
    ```

    Fixing this is simple - just an explaining comment:

    ```Ruby
    # The Dummy class is responsible for ...
    class Dummy
      # Do things...
    end
    ```
LongParameterList:
  remediation_points: 500_000
  content: |
    A `Long Parameter List` occurs when a method has a lot of parameters.

    ## Example

    Given

    ```Ruby
    class Dummy
      def long_list(foo,bar,baz,fling,flung)
        puts foo,bar,baz,fling,flung
      end
    end
    ```

    Reek would report the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 1 warning:
      [2]:Dummy#long_list has 5 parameters (LongParameterList)
    ```

    A common solution to this problem would be the introduction of parameter objects.
LongYieldList:
  remediation_points: 500_000
  content: |
    A _Long Yield List_ occurs when a method yields a lot of arguments to the block it gets passed.

    ## Example

    ```Ruby
    class Dummy
      def yields_a_lot(foo,bar,baz,fling,flung)
        yield foo,bar,baz,fling,flung
      end
    end
    ```

    Reek would report the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 1 warning:
      [4]:Dummy#yields_a_lot yields 5 parameters (LongYieldList)
    ```

    A common solution to this problem would be the introduction of parameter objects.
ManualDispatch:
  remediation_points: 350_000
  content: |
    Reek reports a _Manual Dispatch_ smell if it finds source code that manually checks whether an object responds to a method before that method is called. Manual dispatch is a type of Simulated Polymorphism which leads to code that is harder to reason about, debug, and refactor.

    ## Example

    ```Ruby
    class MyManualDispatcher
      attr_reader :foo

      def initialize(foo)
        @foo = foo
      end

      def call
        foo.bar if foo.respond_to?(:bar)
      end
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 1 warning:
      [9]: MyManualDispatcher manually dispatches method call (ManualDispatch)
    ```
ModuleInitialize:
  remediation_points: 350_000
  content: |
    A module is usually a mixin, so when an `#initialize` method is present it is
    hard to tell initialization order and parameters so having `#initialize`
    in a module is usually a bad idea.

    ## Example

    The `Foo` module below contains a method `initialize`. Although class `B` inherits from `A`, the inclusion of `Foo` stops `A#initialize` from being called.

    ```Ruby
    class A
      def initialize(a)
        @a = a
      end
    end

    module Foo
      def initialize(foo)
        @foo = foo
      end
    end

    class B < A
      include Foo

      def initialize(b)
        super('bar')
        @b = b
      end
    end
    ```

    A simple solution is to rename `Foo#initialize` and call that method by name:

    ```Ruby
    module Foo
      def setup_foo_module(foo)
        @foo = foo
      end
    end

    class B < A
      include Foo

      def initialize(b)
        super 'bar'
        setup_foo_module('foo')
        @b = b
      end
    end
    ```
NestedIterators:
  remediation_points: 500_000
  content: |
    A `Nested Iterator` occurs when a block contains another block.

    ## Example

    Given

    ```Ruby
    class Duck
      class << self
        def duck_names
          %i!tick trick track!.each do |surname|
            %i!duck!.each do |last_name|
              puts "full name is #{surname} #{last_name}"
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    Reek would report the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 1 warning:
      [5]:Duck#duck_names contains iterators nested 2 deep (NestedIterators)
    ```
NilCheck:
  remediation_points: 250_000
  content: |
    A `NilCheck` is a type check. Failures of `NilCheck` violate the ["tell, don't ask"](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/tell-dont-ask) principle.

    Additionally, type checks often mask bigger problems in your source code like not using OOP and / or polymorphism when you should.

    ## Example

    Given

    ```Ruby
    class Klass
      def nil_checker(argument)
        if argument.nil?
          puts "argument isn't nil!"
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 1 warning:
      [3]:Klass#nil_checker performs a nil-check. (NilCheck)
    ```
PrimaDonnaMethod:
  remediation_points: 250_000
  content: |
    A candidate method for the `Prima Donna Method` smell are methods whose names end with an exclamation mark.

    An exclamation mark in method names means (the explanation below is taken from [here](http://dablog.rubypal.com/2007/8/15/bang-methods-or-danger-will-rubyist) ):

    >>
    The ! in method names that end with ! means, “This method is dangerous”—or, more precisely, this method is the “dangerous” version of an otherwise equivalent method, with the same name minus the !. “Danger” is relative; the ! doesn’t mean anything at all unless the method name it’s in corresponds to a similar but bang-less method name.
    So, for example, gsub! is the dangerous version of gsub. exit! is the dangerous version of exit. flatten! is the dangerous version of flatten. And so forth.

    Such a method is called `Prima Donna Method` if and only if her non-bang version does not exist and this method is reported as a smell.

    ## Example

    Given

    ```Ruby
    class C
      def foo; end
      def foo!; end
      def bar!; end
    end
    ```

    Reek would report `bar!` as `prima donna method` smell but not `foo!`.

    Reek reports this smell only in a class context, not in a module context in order to allow perfectly legit code like this:


    ```Ruby
    class Parent
      def foo; end
    end

    module Dangerous
      def foo!; end
    end

    class Son < Parent
      include Dangerous
    end

    class Daughter < Parent
    end
    ```

    In this example, Reek would not report the `prima donna method` smell for the method `foo` of the `Dangerous` module.
RepeatedConditional:
  remediation_points: 400_000
  content: |
    `Repeated Conditional` is a special case of `Simulated Polymorphism`. Basically it means you are checking the same value throughout a single class and take decisions based on this.

    ## Example

    Given

    ```Ruby
    class RepeatedConditionals
      attr_accessor :switch

      def repeat_1
        puts "Repeat 1!" if switch
      end

      def repeat_2
        puts "Repeat 2!" if switch
      end

      def repeat_3
        puts "Repeat 3!" if switch
      end
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 4 warnings:
      [5, 9, 13]:RepeatedConditionals tests switch at least 3 times (RepeatedConditional)
    ```

    If you get this warning then you are probably not using the right abstraction or even more probable, missing an additional abstraction.
TooManyInstanceVariables:
  remediation_points: 500_000
  content: |
    `Too Many Instance Variables` is a special case of `LargeClass`.

    ## Example

    Given this configuration

    ```yaml
    TooManyInstanceVariables:
      max_instance_variables: 3
    ```

    and this code:

    ```Ruby
    class TooManyInstanceVariables
      def initialize
        @arg_1 = :dummy
        @arg_2 = :dummy
        @arg_3 = :dummy
        @arg_4 = :dummy
      end
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 5 warnings:
      [1]:TooManyInstanceVariables has at least 4 instance variables (TooManyInstanceVariables)
    ```
TooManyConstants:
  remediation_points: 500_000
  content: |
    `Too Many Constants` is a special case of `LargeClass`.

    ## Example

    Given this configuration

    ```yaml
    TooManyConstants:
      max_constants: 3
    ```

    and this code:

    ```Ruby
    class TooManyConstants
      CONST_1 = :dummy
      CONST_2 = :dummy
      CONST_3 = :dummy
      CONST_4 = :dummy
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 1 warnings:
      [1]:TooManyConstants has 4 constants (TooManyConstants)
    ```
TooManyMethods:
  remediation_points: 500_000
  content: |
    `Too Many Methods` is a special case of `LargeClass`.

    ## Example

    Given this configuration

    ```yaml
    TooManyMethods:
      max_methods: 3
    ```

    and this code:

    ```Ruby
    class TooManyMethods
      def one; end
      def two; end
      def three; end
      def four; end
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    test.rb -- 1 warning:
      [1]:TooManyMethods has at least 4 methods (TooManyMethods)
    ```
TooManyStatements:
  remediation_points: 500_000
  content: |
    A method with `Too Many Statements` is any method that has a large number of lines.

    `Too Many Statements` warns about any method that has more than 5 statements. Reek's smell detector for `Too Many Statements` counts +1 for every simple statement in a method and +1 for every statement within a control structure (`if`, `else`, `case`, `when`, `for`, `while`, `until`, `begin`, `rescue`) but it doesn't count the control structure itself.

    So the following method would score +6 in Reek's statement-counting algorithm:

    ```Ruby
    def parse(arg, argv, &error)
      if !(val = arg) and (argv.empty? or /\A-/ =~ (val = argv[0]))
        return nil, block, nil                                         # +1
      end
      opt = (val = parse_arg(val, &error))[1]                          # +2
      val = conv_arg(*val)                                             # +3
      if opt and !arg
        argv.shift                                                     # +4
      else
        val[0] = nil                                                   # +5
      end
      val                                                              # +6
    end
    ```

    (You might argue that the two assigments within the first @if@ should count as statements, and that perhaps the nested assignment should count as +2.)
UncommunicativeMethodName:
  remediation_points: 150_000
  content: |
    An `Uncommunicative Method Name` is a method name that doesn't communicate its intent well enough.

    Poor names make it hard for the reader to build a mental picture of what's going on in the code. They can also be mis-interpreted; and they hurt the flow of reading, because the reader must slow down to interpret the names.

    An `Uncommunicative Variable Name` is a variable name that doesn't communicate its intent well enough.

UnusedParameters:
  remediation_points: 200_000
  content: |
    `Unused Parameter` refers to methods with parameters that are unused in scope of the method.

    Having unused parameters in a method is code smell because leaving dead code in a method can never improve the method and it makes the code confusing to read.

    ## Example

    Given:

    ```Ruby
    class Klass
      def unused_parameters(x,y,z)
        puts x,y # but not z
      end
    end
    ```

    Reek would emit the following warning:

    ```
    [2]:Klass#unused_parameters has unused parameter 'z' (UnusedParameters)
    ```
UnusedPrivateMethod:
  remediation_points: 200_000
  content: |
    Classes should use their private methods. Otherwise this is dead
    code which is confusing and bad for maintenance.

    The `Unused Private Method` detector reports unused private instance
    methods and instance methods only - class methods are ignored.

    ## Example

    Given:

    ```Ruby
    class Car
      private
      def drive; end
      def start; end
    end
    ```

    `Reek` would emit the following warning:

    ```
    2 warnings:
      [3]:Car has the unused private instance method `drive` (UnusedPrivateMethod)
      [4]:Car has the unused private instance method `start` (UnusedPrivateMethod)
    ```
UtilityFunction:

  content: |
    A _Utility Function_ is any instance method that has no dependency on the state of the instance.

    Subclassing core classes in Ruby can lead to unexpected side effects.

    Knowing that Ruby has a core library, which is written in C,
    and a standard library, which is written in Ruby,
    if you do not know exactly how these core classes operate at the C level,
    you are gonna have a bad time.
