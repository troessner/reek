    #
    # Control Coupling occurs when a method or block checks the value of
    # a parameter in order to decide which execution path to take. The
    # offending parameter is often called a Control Couple.
    #
    # A simple example would be the <tt>quoted</tt> parameter
    # in the following method:
    #
    #  def write(quoted)
    #    if quoted
    #      write_quoted(@value)
    #    else
    #      puts @value
    #    end
    #  end
    #
    # Control Coupling is a kind of duplication, because the calling method
    # already knows which path should be taken.
    #
    # Control Coupling reduces the code's flexibility by creating a
    # dependency between the caller and callee:
    # any change to the possible values of the controlling parameter must
    # be reflected on both sides of the call.
    #
    # A Control Couple also reveals a loss of simplicity: the called
    # method probably has more than one responsibility,
    # because it includes at least two different code paths.
    #
    # One possible solution is to use the Strategy Pattern
    # to pass into the callee what must be done.  This is
    # not considered to be control coupling because the
    # callee will do the same thing with the strategy,
    # whatever it happens to be.  Sometimes in Ruby the
    # strategy may actually just be a block passed in, and
    # that remains next to where the caller invokes it in
    # the source code.
    #
    # See {file:docs/Control-Parameter.md} for details.
